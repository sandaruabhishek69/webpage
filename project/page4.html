                <p class="gg">Before film, Japan had already several forms of entertainment based in storytelling and images.
                     Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation. Emakimono was common in 
                     the eleventh century.[6] Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the
                      emakimono was unrolled from the right to left with chronological order, as a moving panorama
                      .[6] Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China.[6]
                       Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.[6] The paper
                        play called Kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street 
                        theater until the 1930s.[6] Puppets of the bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered
                         ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations.[6] Finally, manga were a heavy 
                         inspiration for Japanese animation. Cartoonists Kitazawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used 
                         film elements in their strips in the early 20th century.[6]</p>
                         <h1>Origins of anime (1900s – 1922)</h1>
                         <p class="gg">According to Natsuki Matsumoto, the first animated film produced in Japan may have
                            stemmed from as early as 1907. Known as Katsudō Shashin (活動写真, "Activity Photo"),
                            from its depiction of a boy in a sailor suit drawing the characters for katsudō shashin, 
                            the film was first found in 2005. It consists of fifty frames stencilled directly onto
                             a strip of celluloid.[7][8] This claim has not been verified though and predates the 
                             first known showing of animated films in Japan. The date and first film publicly
                              displayed is another source of contention: while no Japanese-produced animation is 
                              definitively known to date before 1916, the possibility exists that other films 
                              entered Japan and that no known records have surfaced to prove a showing prior to 
                              1912.[1] Film titles have surfaced over the years, but none have been proven to 
                              predate this year. The first foreign animation is known to have been found in Japan
                               in 1910, but it is not clear if the film was ever shown in a cinema or publicly 
                               displayed at all. Yasushi Watanabe found a film known as Fushigi no Bōrudo
                                (不思議のボールド, "Miracle Board") in the records of the Yoshizawa Shōten (吉沢商店)
                                 company. The description matches James Blackton's Humorous Phases of Funny Faces, 
                                 though academic consensus on whether or not this is a true animated film is 
                                 disputed.[1] According to Kyokko Yoshiyama, the first animated film called Nippāru 
                                 no Henkei (ニッパールの変形, "Nippāru's Transformation") was shown in Japan at the 
                                 Asakusa Teikokukan (浅草帝国館) in Tokyo sometime in 1912. However, Yoshiyama did 
                                 not refer to the film as "animation." The first confirmed animated film shown in 
                                 Japan was Les Exploits de Feu Follet by Émile Cohl on May 15, 1912. 
                                 While speculation and other "trick films" have been found in Japan, it is the first
                                  recorded account of a public showing of a two-dimensional animated film in 
                                  Japanese cinema. During this time, German animations marketed for home release were distributed
                                   in Japan.[1] In 1914, U.S. and European cartoons were introduced to Japan,[9] inspiring Japanese 
                                   creators like Junichi Kouchi and Seitaro Kitayama,[10] both of whom were considered the "fathers
                                    of anime."</p>
                                    <h1>Pre-war productions (1923–1939)</h1>
                                    <p class="gg">Yasuji Murata, Hakuzan Kimura, Sanae Yamamoto and Noburō Ōfuji were students of Kitayama Seitaro
                                         and worked at his film studio. Kenzō Masaoka, another important animator, worked at a smaller 
                                         animation studio. Many early animated Japanese films were lost after the 1923 Tokyo earthquake, 
                                         including destroying most of the Kitayama studio, with artists trying to incorporate traditional 
                                         motifs and stories into a new form.[13]Prewar animators faced several difficulties. First,
                                          they had to compete with foreign producers such as Disney, which were influential on
                                           both audiences and producers.[14] Foreign films had already made a profit abroad, and 
                                           could be undersold in the Japanese market, priced lower than what domestic producers 
                                           needed to break even.[15][16] Japanese animators thus had to work cheaply, in small 
                                           companies with only a handful of employees, which then made it difficult to compete in terms 
                                           of quality with foreign product that was in color, with sound, and promoted by much bigger 
                                           companies. Until the mid-1930s, Japanese animation generally used cutout animation instead 
                                           of cel animation because the celluloid was too expensive.[17] This resulted in animation that 
                                           could seem derivative, flat (since motion forward and backward was difficult) and without 
                                           detail.[18] But just as postwar Japanese animators were able to turn limited animation into 
                                           a plus, so masters such as Yasuji Murata and Noburō Ōfuji were able to perform wonders that 
                                           they made with cutout animation.   Animators such as Kenzo Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, however, did 
                                           attempt to bring Japanese animation up to the level of foreign work by introducing cel animation, sound, 
                                           and technology such as the multiplane camera. Masaoka created the first talkie anime, Chikara to Onna no 
                                           Yo no Naka, released in 1933,[19][20] and the first anime made entirely using cel animation, The Dance of the 
                                           Chagamas (1934).[21] Seo was the first to use the multiplane camera in Ari-chan in 1941.
                                        Such innovations, however, were difficult to support purely commercially, so prewar animation depended considerably 
                                        on sponsorship, as animators often concentrated on making PR films for companies, educational films for the government, 
                                        and eventually works of propaganda for the military.[22] During this time, censorship and school regulations discouraged
                                         film-viewing by children, so anime that could possess educational value was supported and encouraged by the Monbusho 
                                         (the Ministry of Education). This proved important for producers that had experienced obstacles releasing their work 
                                         in regular theatres. Animation had found a place in scholastic, political, and industrial use</p>
                                <h1>2000s</h1><div class="bb"></div>
                                <p class="gg">The "Evangelion-era" trend continued into the 2000s with Evangelion-inspired mecha anime such as RahXephon (2002) and Zegapain (2006) – RahXephon was also intended to help revive 1970s-style mecha designs. The number of anime productions began to decline after peaking in 2006 due to alternative forms of entertainment, less ad revenue, and other reasons, with TV Tokyo remaining one of the only channels airing anime shows.[16] Even so, anime began entering U.S. homes like never before, with fans able to get their hands on Japanese-language originals of anime they watched, thanks to the internet.[61]

                                    The real robot genre (including the Gundam and Macross franchises), which had declined during the 1990s, was revived in the early 2000s with the success of shows such as Mobile Suit Gundam SEED (2002), Eureka Seven (2005), Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006), Mobile Suit Gundam 00 (2007), and Macross Frontier (2008).[62]
                                    
                                    The 1970s-style super robot genre revival began with GaoGaiGar in 1997 and continued into the 2000s, with several remakes of classic series such as Getter Robo and Dancougar, as well as original titles created in the super robot mold like Godannar and Gurren Lagann. Gurren Lagann in particular combined the super robot genre with elements from 1980s real robot shows, as well as 1990s "post-Evangelion" shows. Gurren Lagann received both the "best television production" and "best character design" awards from the Tokyo International Anime Fair in 2008.[63] This eventually culminated in the release of Shin Mazinger in 2009, a full-length revival of the first super robot series, Mazinger Z.
                                    
                                    An art movement started by Takashi Murakami that combined Japanese pop-culture with postmodern art called Superflat began around this time. Murakami asserts that the movement is an analysis of post-war Japanese culture through the eyes of the otaku subculture. His desire is also to get rid of the categories of 'high' and 'low' art making a flat continuum, hence the term 'superflat'. His art exhibitions have gained popularity overseas and have influenced a handful of anime creators, particularly those from Studio 4 °C.[64]
                                    
                                    The experimental late night anime trend popularized by Serial Experiments Lain also continued into the 2000s with experimental anime such as Boogiepop Phantom (2000), Texhnolyze (2003), Elfen Lied (2004), Paranoia Agent (2004), Gantz (2004), and Ergo Proxy (2006). Elfen Lied in particular being aired on subsidiary premium network AT-X, allowing director Mamoru Kanbe to push the boundaries of violence, nudity, and story themes, as well as employ unique artistic elements such as artwork inspired by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt. [65]
                                    
                                    Before the massive boom from companies like Funimation and Adult Swim, view or even obtaining anime in the United States was quite difficult since the market value and the interest in the states as quite low many broadcasting companies would not bother with airing the shows. This was due to a number of factors one of which was getting the show translated. In the modern we have anime that is dubbed over with English voices making it easier for western audiences. However in the early 90's when anime was first stating to become big that was not available. Many fans of the genre would translate the show themselves and would post them online for others to view.[66] This trend would continue until September 2, 2001. This is when the show Cowboy Bebop first aired on the broad casting network Adult Swim and was the first anime to be broadcast on live television.[67] The show was an instant success, the only problem being the air time was late and at night, meaning that the audience was subject to a small number of people.[68]
                                    
                                    In addition to these experimental trends, the 2000s were also characterized by an increase of moe-style art and bishōjo and bishōnen character design. There was a rising presence and popularity of genres such as romance, harem and slice of life.
                                    
                                    Anime based on eroge and visual novels increased in popularity in the 2000s, building on a trend started in the late 1990s by such works as Sentimental Journey (1998) and To Heart (1999). Examples of such works include Green Green (2003), SHUFFLE! (2006), Kanon (2002 and 2006), Fate/Stay Night (2006), Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (2006), Ef: A Tale of Memories (2007), True Tears (2008), and Clannad (2008 and 2009).
                                    
                                    Many shows have been adapted from manga and light novels, including popular titles such as Yu-Gi-Oh! (2000), Inuyasha (2000), Naruto and its sequel series Naruto Shippuden (2002 and 2007), Fullmetal Alchemist and its manga faithful adaptation Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (2003 and 2009), Monster (2004), Bleach (2004), Rozen Maiden (2005), Aria the Animation (2005), Shakugan no Shana (2005), Pani Poni Dash! (2005), Death Note (2006), Mushishi (2006), Sola (2007), The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2006), Lucky Star (2007), Toradora! (2008), K-On! (2009), Bakemonogatari (2009), and Fairy Tail (2009); these shows typically last several years and achieve large fanbases. Nevertheless, original anime titles continue to be produced with the same success.
                                    
                                    The 2000s marked a trend of emphasis of the otaku subculture. A notable critique of this otaku subculture is found in the 2006 anime Welcome to the N.H.K., which features a hikikomori (socially withdrawn) protagonist and explores the effects and consequences of various Japanese sub-cultures, such as otaku, lolicon, internet suicide, massively multiplayer online games and multi-level marketing.
                                    
                                    In contrast to the above-mentioned phenomenon, there have been more productions of late-night anime for a non-otaku audience as well. The first concentrated effort came from Fuji TV's Noitamina block. The 30-minute late-Thursday timeframe was created to showcase productions for young women of college age, a demographic that watches very little anime. The first production Honey and Clover was a particular success, peaking at a 5% TV rating in Kantou, very strong for late-night anime. The block has been running uninterrupted since April 2005 and has yielded many successful productions unique in the modern anime market.
                                    
                                    There have been revivals of American cartoons such as Transformers which spawned four new series, Transformers: Car Robots in 2000, Transformers: Micron Legend in 2003, Transformers: Superlink in 2004, and Transformers: Galaxy Force in 2005. In addition, an anime adaptation of the G.I Joe series was produced titled G.I. Joe: Sigma 6.
                                    
                                    The revival of earlier anime series was seen in the forms of Fist of the North Star: The Legends of the True Savior (2006) and Dragon Ball Z Kai (2009). Later series also started receiving revivals in the late 2000s and early 2010s, such as with Studio Khara's Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy (2007–2021), and new adaptations of Masamune Shirow's manga Appleseed XIII (2011) and Ghost in the Shell: Arise (2013–2016).
                                    
                                    The decade also dawned a revival of high-budget feature-length anime films, such as Millennium Actress (2001), Metropolis (2001), Appleseed (2001), Paprika (2006), and the most expensive of all being Steamboy (2004) which cost $26 million to produce. Satoshi Kon established himself alongside Otomo and Oshii as one of the premier directors of anime film, before his premature death at the age of 46. Other younger film directors, such as Mamoru Hosoda, director of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006) and Summer Wars (2009), also began to reach prominence.
                                    
                                    During this decade, anime feature films were nominated for and won major international film awards for the first time in the industry's history. In 2002, Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli production directed by Hayao Miyazaki, won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and in 2003 at the 75th Academy Awards it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the first non-American film to win the award and is one of only two to do so. It has also become the highest grossing anime film, with a worldwide box office of US$274 million.
                                    
                                    Following the launch of the Toonami programming block on Cartoon Network in the United States in March 1997, anime saw a giant rise in the North American market. Kid-friendly anime such as Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Digimon, Doraemon, Bakugan, Beyblade, Sonic X, and the 4Kids Entertainment adaptation of One Piece have all received varying levels of success. This era also saw the rise of Anime-influenced animation, most notably Avatar: the Last Airbender and its sequel The Legend of Korra, Megas XLR, Code Lyoko, Ben 10, Chaotic, Samurai Jack, The Boondocks, RWBY and Teen Titans. As such, anime further became entrenched in U.S. households with the launch of Adult Swim by Cartoon Network in 2001, aimed at those in the "older OVA & tape trading crowd," with a new fandom forming.[69] This fandom was, however, exclusive and elitist with newcomers expected to know how to use IRC, some basic Japanese, and so on.
                                    
                                    At the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, directed by Mamoru Oshii, was in competition for the Palme d'Or and in 2006, at the 78th Academy Awards, Howl's Moving Castle, another Studio Ghibli-produced film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, was nominated for Best Animated Feature. 5 centimeters Per Second, directed by Makoto Shinkai, won the inaugural Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2007, and so far, anime films have been nominated for the award every year.
                                    
                                    By 2004, over two hundred shows were aired on television.[49]</p>

                                    <p class="gg">In May 2012, the Toonami programming block in the United States was relaunched as a late night adult-oriented action block on Adult Swim, bringing more uncut popular anime back to a wider audience on cable television. In addition to broadcasting or re-broadcasting previously released dubbed anime, the block (as well as Adult Swim itself) has overseen the worldwide premiere of English dubbed releases for various anime, including but not limited to: Durarara!! (2010), Deadman Wonderland (2011), Hunter x Hunter (2011), Sword Art Online (2012), JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012), Attack on Titan (2013), Kill la Kill (2013), Space Dandy (2014), Akame ga Kill! (2014), Parasyte -the maxim- (2014), One-Punch Man (2015), Dragon Ball Super (2015), My Hero Academia (2016), Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2017), and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba (2019).[71]

                                        On September 6, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki announced that The Wind Rises (2013) would be his last film, and on August 3, 2014, it was announced that Studio Ghibli was "temporarily halting production" following the release of When Marnie Was There (2014), further substantiating the finality of Miyazaki's retirement. The disappointing sales of Isao Takahata's comeback film The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) has also been cited as a factor.[72] Several prominent staffers, including producer Yoshiaki Nishimura and director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, left to form their own Studio Ponoc, premièring with Mary and the Witch's Flower (2017).[73][74][75] Both Ghibli and Miyazaki subsequently went back into production for the 2023 film The Boy and the Heron,[76] while Takahata died on April 5, 2018, of lung cancer.[77]
                                        
                                        Various international anime distribution companies, such as ADV Films, Bandai Entertainment, and Geneon Entertainment, were shut down due to poor revenue, with their assets spun into new companies like Sentai Filmworks or given to other companies.[78]
                                        
                                        In 2011, Puella Magi Madoka Magica was aired in Japan. The anime was a change from normal magical girl anime, as this anime contained more darker, complex and more gorier themes than magical anime usually would. The anime got great reception from critics, as United Kingdom's Anime Network's Andy Hanley rated it a 10 out of 10 for its emotional content and evocative soundtrack.
                                        
                                        Both Attack on Titan and The Wind Rises reflect a national debate surrounding the reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, with Miyazaki's pacifism in the film coming under fire from the political right,[79] while Attack on Titan has been accused of promoting militarism by people in neighboring Asian countries, despite being intended to show the haunting, hopeless aspects of conflict.[80] The mecha anime genre (as well as Japanese kaiju films) received a Western homage with the 2013 film Pacific Rim directed by Guillermo del Toro.[81]
                                        
                                        Western streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are increasingly becoming involved in the production and licensing of anime for the international markets.[82][83]
                                        
                                        In 2015, an all-record-high of three hundred forty anime series aired on television.[49]</p>

                                        <p class="gg">The global popularity and demand of anime continued to rise during the decade due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the medium's wide availability on streaming services.[84][85][86][87]

                                            Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train became the highest-grossing Japanese film and the world's highest-grossing film of 2020.[88] It also became the fastest grossing film in Japanese cinema, because in 10 days it made 10 billion yen ($95.3m; £72m).[88] It beat the previous record of Spirited Away which took 25 days.[88]
                                            
                                            In 2021, the anime adaptations of Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and Tokyo Revengers were among the top 10 most discussed TV shows worldwide on X (then known as Twitter).[89][90]
                                            
                                            In 2022, Attack on Titan won the award of "Most In-Demand TV Series in the World 2021" in the Global TV Demand Awards. Attack on Titan became the first ever non-English language series to earn the title of World's Most In-Demand TV Show, previously held by only The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.[91]
                                            
                                            In 2023, the opening theme Idol by YOASOBI of the anime series Oshi no Ko topped the Billboard Global 200 Excl. U.S. charts with 45.7 million streams and 24,000 copies sold outside the U.S. "Idol" has become the first Japanese song and anime song to top the Billboard Global chart as well as taking the first spot on the Apple Music's Top 100: Global chart.[92][93]
