                        Your Entries or Comments:  Information you provide when participating in one of our competitions, prize draws, or one of our surveys or consumer research.
                        Your Enquiries: Information you provide when you contact us seeking customer support.
                        User-Generated Content: When we provide you the opportunity to upload or share user-generated content, we will collect information that you provide to us through our Content, such as photographs, video images or other content that you may upload.
                        Usage Information: We and our third-party partners and service providers, such as Google Analytics and/or Adobe Analytics, may use a variety of technologies that collect and provide information about how the Content is accessed and used. Usage Information may consist of your internet browser type and version, operating system, service provider, the webpages, videos and apps you viewed, the time you viewed them and for how long, game or video history, skill level, demographic information about you (such as your age, gender, language, location and interest areas, where available), time zone, language, and what you looked at before accessing our Content. For more information about the collection of some of this information, please also see the section on Cookies and Similar Tracking Technology.
                        Device Identifiers: We may also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier for the computer, mobile device, technology, or other device you use to access the Content. A unique identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your device by this number. Some service providers may also provide us with the physical location of the device used to access the Content. For more information about the collection of some of this information, please also see the section on Cookies and Similar Tracking Technology.
                        Our sites and applications may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us. When you leave our site or platform your information may be collected by a third party and subject to their privacy and cookie notice.</p>
                    <h1 class="yy">INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES</h1>
                    <p class="oo">The Content may include hyperlinks in association with the Content, plug-ins, websites, locations, platforms, applications, or other services operated by third parties ("Third-Party Service(s)"). These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Data from you. Their privacy policies apply in such cases, and not this Policy.

                        Certain functionalities on the Content permit interactions that you initiate between the Content and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Content and a Third-Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” SPE’s content; logging in to the Content using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Content to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Content). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Content or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Content (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with SPE or Sony group companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Content or otherwise by SPE and Sony group companies. Also, both SPE and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Content and any Third-Party Service.  Third-Party Services may in certain circumstances provide SPE certain Personal Data, such as identification data, demographic information, contact information, your comments and user generated content, usage information, inferences about you, and device identifiers.  To the extent relevant under applicable law, where we control your Personal Data jointly with third parties, we will provide you with information about this relationship at the point of collection or through the Cookie Consent Tool.</p>
